## General Guidelines

- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
- Avoid deep nesting of code blocks.
- Use proper error handling and avoid swallowing exceptions.
- Write self-explanatory code and avoid unnecessary comments.
- Follow the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles when designing classes and modules.

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and object properties.
- Use PascalCase for classes and constructor functions.
- Use uppercase snake_case for constants and enum values.

## Spacing and Indentation

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use spaces around operators and after commas.
- Place an opening brace on the same line as the statement or declaration.
- Use a space between the `if` keyword and the opening parenthesis.

## Variables

- Use `const` for variables that will not be reassigned, and `let` for variables that will be reassigned.
- Declare each variable on a separate line to improve readability.
- Initialize variables at the point of declaration whenever possible.
- Avoid global variables and minimize the scope of variables.

## Functions

- Use function declarations or arrow function expressions for named functions.
- Use concise arrow function syntax (`() =>`) for callbacks and anonymous functions.
- Use meaningful and descriptive function names.
- Limit the number of function arguments to improve readability.
- Avoid unnecessary side effects in functions.

## Conditional Statements and Loops

- Use strict equality (`===` and `!==`) for comparisons.
- Avoid unnecessary negations (`!`) in conditions.
- Use `for...of` loops for iterating over arrays and other iterable objects.
- Prefer `for...of` over `for...in` for iterating over object keys.
- Use `Array#forEach` or higher-order array methods when appropriate.

## Error Handling

- Use `try...catch` blocks for catching and handling exceptions.
- Avoid catching generic `Error` objects unless necessary.
- Always provide informative error messages when throwing exceptions.

## Comments

- Use comments to explain complex algorithms, business rules, or any non-obvious code.
- Write self-explanatory code and avoid excessive comments.
- Remove commented-out code before committing changes.

## Modules

- Use ES6 modules (`import` and `export`) for managing dependencies.
- Avoid using the `import` statement without a corresponding `export` statement.
- Prefer default exports for single exports and named exports for multiple exports.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for critical and complex functionality.
- Use a testing framework such as [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).
- Separate test files from source files and follow a consistent naming convention.
- Run tests automatically as part of the development process.
